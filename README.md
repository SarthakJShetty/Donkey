# Donkey: a self driving library and control platform for small scale DIY vehicles. 

##### About

- Donkey is minimalist and modular self driving library written in Python. It is developed for hobbiests with a focus on allowing fast experimentation and easy community contributions.  

- This specific variant was developed by Will Roscoe and his team. The code for the Differential Drive variant was however non-functional, and was later fixed by [Sarthak J Shetty](https://www.github.com/SarthakJShetty). The code is still buggy, and a few of the features do not work completely. Suggestions are always welcome.

### Build a Differential Drive Donkey Car

#### [Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11IPqZcDcLTd2mtYaR5ONpDxFgL9Y1nMNTDvEarST8Wk/edit#)
These instructions are for the Version 2 Donkey Car. The advantage of using a Differential Drive Donkey Car is that you do not have additional hardware components such as an ESC or camera mounts.

#### [Here it is in action!](https://youtu.be/0Sid7q3nsWY)

#### Features:
1. Data logging of image, steering angle, & throttle outputs. 

2. The bot is controlled over Wi-Fi from a host, using either a virtual or physical joystick and keyboard.

3. Support of the Donkey Car Community (over 1,000 members at the time of this update.)

4. CAD Models are available to print the camera mounts.

5. Completely open-source.

#### About:
- This repository is not bug free version

- However, the code works for the most part, and the vehicle does [work](https://youtu.be/0Sid7q3nsWY) in learning and autonomous modes.

- You will primarily require:
	- [Raspberry Pi 3](https://goo.gl/W2Hrkb)
	- [Raspberry Pi Module V2](https://goo.gl/frghxB) (can be swapped for a different model later on)
	- [Adafruit MotorHAT Controller](https://goo.gl/ofLpUK)

- The Project Report has been uploaded [here.](https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/My-Donkey/blob/master/Project_Report/NITK_Summer_Report.pdf) as well.
